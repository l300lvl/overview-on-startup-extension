### Description: 

A simple extension with a primary task of launching the Overview at each start of Gnome Shell, e.g on login. 

Influenced by @gevera, the Applications/Frequent view is default, but has an option to show the Windows view. 

todo: eventually show the Overview when no windows are open or none are in focus, regardless of workspace/s and settings
